The model architecture could be further refined to present a more comprehensive overview of the process. Additionally, the data extraction and preprocessing steps should be explained briefly to improve understanding and allow replication of the methodology. To enhance the analysis, metrics such as the AUC/ROC curve could be included to evaluate the model's performance during training. Furthermore, a confusion matrix should be provided to offer deeper insights into the model's classification performance.

The paper is well-written and demonstrates excellent quality, with a clear and logical workflow.

The paper is well-written and demonstrates excellent quality, with a clear and logical workflow. The proposed framework holds significant potential for advancing the medical field, particularly in human activity analysis, such as monitoring patient mobility, progress, and early detection of movement disorders.

The dataset used for the study was acquired from  Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The dataset comprises 21,976 DICOM files, divided into 17,580 training images, 2,198 validation images, and 2,198 testing images, each annotated with key demographic and diagnostic information. Participants are categorized into three diagnostic groups: CN, MCI, and AD. Longitudinal data collected over multiple visits (baseline, year 1, and year 2) enables the analysis of disease progression and structural brain changes over time. This longitudinal aspect supports the study of transitions from MCI to AD, a critical area of research for developing early intervention strategies.

The dataset features advanced MRI modalities and sequences tailored to investigate neurodegenerative changes. Key sequences include Sagittal 3D FLAIR for detecting white matter lesions, High-Resolution Hippocampus Imaging for assessing hippocampal atrophy, and Axial 3TE T2 STAR for identifying microhemorrhages and iron deposition. Perfusion-Weighted Imaging (PWI) and Axial 3D PASL measure cerebral blood flow dynamics, providing insights into hypoperfusion associated with AD progression. Other sequences, such as T2-FLAIR and T2-TSE with Fat Saturation, enhance tissue contrast for visualizing structural abnormalities, while MPRAGE delivers high-resolution images of cortical and subcortical regions. Standardized imaging protocols, including Field Mapping for correcting distortions and B1-calibration scans, ensure data consistency across participants and visits.

Demographic details, such as sex (male or female), age (ranging from early 60s to over 90 years), and visit timepoints, further enhance the dataset's utility. This diversity ensures the dataset's applicability to real-world clinical scenarios and supports generalized research across diverse populations.
